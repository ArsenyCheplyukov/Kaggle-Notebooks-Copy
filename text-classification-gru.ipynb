They are ASTONISHING, and it shocks me that Cool Cat Saves The Kids got\nsnubbed by the Oscars for Best Special Effects. This film makes 2001 look like\ngarbage, and the directing in this film makes Stanley Kubrick look like the\nworst director ever. You know what other film did that? Birdemic: Shock and\nTerror. Both of these films are masterpieces, but if I had to choose my\nfavorite out of the 2, I would have to go with Cool Cat Saves The Kids. It is\nnow my 10th favorite film of all time.\n\nNow, lets get into the symbolism: So you might be asking yourself, Why is Cool\nCat Orange? Well, I can easily explain. Orange is a color. Orange is also a\nfruit, and its a very good fruit. You know what else is good? Good behavior.\nWhat behavior does Cool Cat have? He has good behavior. This cannot be a\ncoincidence, since cool cat has good behavior in the film.\n\nNow, why is Butch The Bully fat? Well, fat means your wide. You wanna know who\nwas wide? Hitler. Nuff said this cannot be a coincidence.\n\nWhy does Erik Estrada suspect Butch The Bully to be a bully? Well look at it\nthis way. What color of a shirt was Butchy wearing when he walks into the area?\nI don't know, its looks like dark purple/dark blue. Why rhymes with dark? Mark.\nMark is that guy from the Room. The Room is the best movie of all time. What is\nthe opposite of best? Worst. This is how Erik knew Butch was a bully.\n\nand finally, how come Vivica A. Fox isn't having a successful career after\nmaking Kill Bill.\n\nI actually can't answer that question.\n\nWell thanks for reading my review.\n\"\"\"\npredict_sentiment(test_text)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-22T16:24:27.515335Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-22T16:24:27.515677Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-22T16:24:27.525698Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-22T16:24:27.515647Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-22T16:24:27.524574Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"test_text = \"\"\"\nDon't let any bullies out there try and shape your judgment on this gem of a\ntitle.\n\nSome people really don't have anything better to do, except trash a great movie\nwith annoying 1-star votes and spread lies on the Internet about how \"dumb\"\nCool Cat is.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised to learn if much of the unwarranted negativity hurled\nat this movie is coming from people who haven't even watched this movie for\nthemselves in the first place. Those people are no worse than the Butch the\nBully, the film's repulsive antagonist.\n\nAs it just so happens, one of the main points of \"Cool Cat Saves the Kids\" is\nin addressing the attitudes of mean naysayers who try to demean others who\nstrive to bring good attitudes and fun vibes into people's lives. The message\nto be learned here is that if one is friendly and good to others, the world is\nfriendly and good to one in return, and that is cool. Conversely, if one is\nmiserable and leaving 1-star votes on IMDb, one is alone and doesn't have any\nfriends at all. Ain't that the truth?\n\nThe world has uncovered a great, new, young filmmaking talent in \"Cool Cat\"\ncreator Derek Savage, and I sure hope that this is only the first of many\namazing films and stories that the world has yet to appreciate.\n\nIf you are a cool person who likes to have lots of fun, I guarantee that this\nis a movie with charm that will uplift your spirits and reaffirm your positive\nattitudes towards life.\n\"\"\"\npredict_sentiment(test_text)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-22T16:24:58.253058Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-22T16:24:58.253405Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-22T16:24:58.265826Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-22T16:24:58.253377Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-22T16:24:58.264868Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
